        "summary": "Unintended leak of Proxy-Authorization header in requests",
        "details": "### Impact\n\nSince Requests v2.3.0, Requests has been vulnerable to potentially leaking `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)",

        "details": "### Impact\n\nThe `MultipartParser` using the package `python-multipart` accepts an unlimited number of multipart parts (form fields or files).\n\nProcessing too many parts results in high CPU usage and high memory usage, eventually leading to an <abbr title=\"out of memory\">OOM</abbr> process kill.\n\nThis can be triggered by sending too many small form fields with no content, or too many empty files.\n\nFor this to take effect application code has to:\n\n* Have `python-multipart` installed and\n* call `request.form()`\n  * or via another framework like FastAPI, using form field parameters or `UploadFile` parameters, which in turn calls `request.form()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is solved in Starlette 0.25.0 by making the maximum fields and files customizable and with a sensible default (1000). \n\nApplications will be secure by just upgrading their Starlette version to 0.25.0 (or FastAPI to 0.92.0).\n\nIf application code needs to customize the new max field and file number, there are new `request.form()` parameters (with the default values):\n\n* `max_files=1000`\n* `max_fields=1000`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nApplications that don't install `python-multipart` or that don't use form fields are safe.\n\nIn older versions, it's also possible to instead of calling `request.form()` call `request.stream()` and parse the form data in internal code.\n\nIn most cases, the best solution is to upgrade the Starlette version.\n\n### References\n\nThis was reported in private by @das7pad via internal email. He also coordinated the fix across multiple frameworks and parsers.\n\nThe details about how `multipart/form-data` is structured and parsed are in the [RFC 7578](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578).\n",

        "details": "### Summary\nWhen using `StaticFiles`, if there's a file or directory that starts with the same name as the `StaticFiles` directory, that file or directory is also exposed via `StaticFiles` which is a path traversal vulnerability.\n\n### Details\nThe root cause of this issue is the usage of `os.path.commonprefix()`:\nhttps://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/4bab981d9e870f6cee1bd4cd59b87ddaf355b2dc/starlette/staticfiles.py#L172-L174\n\nAs stated in the Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.commonprefix) this function returns the longest prefix common to paths.\n\nWhen passing a path like `/static/../static1.txt`, `os.path.commonprefix([full_path, directory])` returns `./static` which is the common part of `./static1.txt` and `./static`, It refers to `/static/../static1.txt` because it is considered in the staticfiles directory. As a result, it becomes possible to view files that should not be open to the public.\n\nThe solution is to use `os.path.commonpath` as the Python documentation explains that `os.path.commonprefix` works a character at a time, it does not treat the arguments as paths.\n\n### PoC\nIn order to reproduce the issue, you need to create the following structure:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static_disallow\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 static1.txt\n```\n\nAnd run the `Starlette` app with:\n\n```py\nimport uvicorn\nfrom starlette.applications import Starlette\nfrom starlette.routing import Mount\nfrom starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles\n\n\nroutes = [\n    Mount(\"/static\", app=StaticFiles(directory=\"static\", html=True), name=\"static\"),\n]\n\napp = Starlette(routes=routes)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nAnd running the commands:\n\n```shell\ncurl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static_disallow/'\ncurl --path-as-is 'localhost:8000/static/../static1.txt'\n```\nThe `static1.txt` and the directory `static_disallow` are exposed.\n\n### Impact\nConfidentiality is breached: An attacker may obtain files that should not be open to the public.\n\n### Credits\nSecurity researcher **Masashi Yamane of LAC Co., Ltd** reported this vulnerability to **JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Coordination Group** and they contacted us to coordinate a patch for the security issue.\n",
