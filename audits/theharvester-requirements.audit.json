        "details": "### Impact\n\naiohttp v3.8.4 and earlier are [bundled with llhttp v6.0.6](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/v3.8.4/.gitmodules) which is vulnerable to CVE-2023-30589. The vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when available which is the default case when installing from a wheel.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie `aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie `aiohttp.ClientSession`).\n\n### Reproducer\n\n```python\nfrom aiohttp import web\n\nasync def example(request: web.Request):\n    headers = dict(request.headers)\n    body = await request.content.read()\n    return web.Response(text=f\"headers: {headers} body: {body}\")\n\napp = web.Application()\napp.add_routes([web.post('/', example)])\nweb.run_app(app)\n```\n\nSending a crafted HTTP request will cause the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to HTTP request smuggling.\n\n```console\n$ printf \"POST / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost:8080\\r\\nX-Abc: \\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\nA\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\" \\\n  | nc localhost 8080\n\nExpected output:\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '\\rxTransfer-Encoding: chunked'} body: b''\n\nActual output (note that 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' is an HTTP header now and body is treated differently)\n  headers: {'Host': 'localhost:8080', 'X-Abc': '', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'} body: b'A'\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of aiohttp to resolve this vulnerability. It has been fixed in v3.8.5: [`pip install aiohttp >= 3.8.5`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.8.5/)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you aren't able to upgrade you can reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable to request smuggling:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip uninstall --yes aiohttp\n$ AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 python -m pip install --no-binary=aiohttp --no-cache aiohttp\n```\n\n### References\n\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30589\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/2001873\n",

This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS \u2192 HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP \u2192 HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@gmail.com)",
