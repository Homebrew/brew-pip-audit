        "description": "Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)'s setuptools is a library designed to facilitate packaging Python projects. Setuptools version 65.5.0 and earlier could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by fetching malicious HTML from a PyPI package or custom PackageIndex page due to a vulnerable Regular Expression in `package_index`. This has been patched in version 65.5.1."
