        "summary": "Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary",
        "details": "### Summary\n\nWhen parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).\n\n### Impact\n\nApplications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected. \n\n### Original Report\n\nThis security issue was reported by:\n- GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck\n- Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi",
